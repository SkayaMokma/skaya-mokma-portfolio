                  Technology has been an interest of mine since I was just a child playing simple browser games on my parents' laptop. I was most enthralled with having the ability to make anything I can imagine come to life on a screen. In school I took every computer-related course I could and eventually was accepted into the NC State Computer Science program. However, the restrictions due to COVID prevented me from receiving a fulfilling education in the field I've been excited for my whole life. I decided to withdraw and instead enroll in a streamlined course that provided engaging group projects and personalized teaching on a wide range of software-related topics. Throughout this course I have found my niche within the field and have gained the skills and confidence to finally step into my dream career.
